Migrate your G**gle contacts / calendar / ... to Nextcloud/Owncloud

These tools are intended for all those who plan to migrate their personal data like contacts / calendars from the Giant to Nextcloud (or similar).

While the Giant supports exporting your contacts to vCard format, only part of the possibly very detailed information is exported this way. This is *not* just because the appropriate entries are missing in the vCard format. On the contrary, the vCard format has several entries which could be used for exporting more information.

Fortunately, the Giant also offers exporting to a "Google CSV format". This is made use of by the script in this repository.

Note that the script is still *very* incomplete and that there is currently just one script dealing with contacts. Feel free to contact me if you'd like to contribute extensions / complementary tools.
